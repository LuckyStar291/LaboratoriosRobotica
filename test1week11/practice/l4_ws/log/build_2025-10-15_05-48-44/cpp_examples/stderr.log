[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcustom_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "custom_interface"
  with any of the following names:

    custom_interfaceConfig.cmake
    custom_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "custom_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "custom_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "custom_interface" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
